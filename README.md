# MarsWeatherProject

This is another small practice project I did.  I followed along with Kevin Powell on his YouTube channel.

My main takeaway from this; it is an incredible feeling to realize that I can already understand and create pages like this, after only 3 weeks of learning.  The more projects that I do, the more I understand what's actually happening - and most importantly - why it's happening.

I suppose I'll be adding Kevin to the ever-expanding list of people that I owe credit to!!
