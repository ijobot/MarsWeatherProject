# MarsWeatherProject

This is another small practice project I did.  I followed along with Kevin Powell on his YouTube channel.

My main takeaway from this; it is an incredible feeling to realize that I can already understand and create pages like this, after only 3 weeks of learning.  The more projects that I do, the more I understand what's actually happening - and most importantly - why it's happening.

NOTE: this is by far not a finished product.  I was only 3 weeks into self-teaching and barely knew what I was doing.  I'm leaving it this way to be able to look back on it and see how far I've come.
